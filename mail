Dear Team,

We have already completed the PR setup in VLAN 10.177, and in future the IP requirement may further increase.
Currently, we also need servers for the DR setup in the same VLAN (10.177), but we have been informed that the IP pool for this VLAN is already exhausted.

Request you to please suggest how we can proceed so that additional IPs can be allocated in the same VLAN for future requirements and for the current DR setup.

Kindly provide the available options (subnet expansion or extension of IP pool) at the earliest.

Awaiting your update.
