Subject: Request for IP Pool Expansion for VLAN 10.177 (DR Setup Requirement)

Dear Team,

For the DR setup, the server team has informed us that VLAN 10.177 has reached IP exhaustion, due to which new servers cannot be assigned in the same VLAN.
Since we may require additional resources in the future as well, I request you to please review and suggest the best possible option:

Expansion of the existing subnet

Addition of a secondary subnet within VLAN 10.177

Any recommended future-proofing approach for capacity


Kindly check and advise how we can proceed further to ensure DR setup readiness.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]
